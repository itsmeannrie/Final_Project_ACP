-----------------
## üìñ Project Overview

**Xpense Tracker** is a Python-based financial management application designed to help users effectively track their expenses, set monthly budgets, and monitor spending patterns. It integrates user-friendly features like categorizing expenses, generating detailed reports, and alerting users when their spending exceeds budget limits. With a focus on financial literacy and empowerment, this project supports individuals in making informed decisions about their finances.

## üõ†Ô∏è Application of Python Concepts and Libraries
The Xpense Tracker application is designed with fundamental Python concepts and libraries to deliver a simple, efficient, and user-friendly experience:

### 1. Core Python Concepts
- **Functions:**
  - Modular functions (`add_expense`, `view_expenses`, `generate_report`) divide the program into manageable components, improving readability.
  - Utility functions like `get_valid_amount` and `get_date_input` ensure user inputs are accurate and correctly formatted.

- **Control Flow:**
  - Conditional statements (`if-else`) process user menu selections and handle various program operations.
  - Loops (`while`) maintain interactivity, allowing the program to run continuously until the user exits.

- **Enumerations:**
  - The `Enum` class standardizes expense categories (ex: Food, Transport) for better data consistency and validation.

### 2. Data Structures
- **Lists:** Store expense entries dynamically, enabling efficient addition, modification, and deletion.
- **Dictionaries:** Organize user information and monthly budgets, offering quick access and updates.
- **DefaultDict:** From the `collections` module,  it simplifies data grouping and calculations, especially for monthly expense summaries.
### 3. Key Libraries
- **`datetime`:** Validates and handles dates for accurate logging and tracking.
- **`json`:**  Ensures data persistence by saving user details and expense records in a structured format for future use.
- **`collections`:** Simplifies advanced data handling with `DefaultDict`, making data grouping and calculations easier.
### 4. Error Handling
- **Input Validation:**
  - Prevents invalid inputs by verifying numeric values, correctly formatted dates, and valid menu options.
- **File Handling:**
  - Detects and manages issues like missing or corrupted files, ensuring the program starts with a fresh dataset if needed.
- **User Feedback:**
  - Provides clear and actionable error messages, helping users correct mistakes and continue without interruptions.

Xpense Tracker supports **SDG Goal 12** by promoting responsible financial habits.
The program:
- **Encourages Awareness:** Tracks and categorizes expenses, helping users monitor consumption patterns.
- **Fosters Discipline:** Helps users set budgets, avoid overspending, and align spending with financial goals.
- **Empowers Decisions:** Generates monthly reports that provide insights into spending trends, enabling informed choices.
  
By addressing these aspects, Xpense Tracker aligns with the global goal of encouraging sustainable and mindful consumption practices.
