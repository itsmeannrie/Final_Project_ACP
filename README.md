## üõ†Ô∏è Application of Python Concepts and Libraries
The Xpense Tracker application is designed with fundamental Python concepts and libraries to deliver a simple, efficient, and user-friendly experience:

### 1. Core Python Concepts
- **Functions:**
  - Modular functions (`add_expense`, `view_expenses`, `generate_report`) divide the program into manageable components, improving readability.
  - Utility functions like `get_valid_amount` and `get_date_input` ensure user inputs are accurate and correctly formatted.

- **Control Flow:**
  - Conditional statements (`if-else`) process user menu selections and handle various program operations.
  - Loops (`while`) maintain interactivity, allowing the program to run continuously until the user exits.

- **Enumerations:**
  - The `Enum` class standardizes expense categories (ex: Food, Transport) for better data consistency and validation.

### 2. Data Structures
- **Lists:** Store expense entries dynamically, enabling efficient addition, modification, and deletion.
- **Dictionaries:** Organize user information and monthly budgets, offering quick access and updates.
- **DefaultDict:** From the `collections` module,  it simplifies data grouping and calculations, especially for monthly expense summaries.
### 3. Key Libraries
- **`datetime`:** Validates and handles dates for accurate logging and tracking.
- **`json`:**  Ensures data persistence by saving user details and expense records in a structured format for future use.
- **`collections`:** Simplifies advanced data handling with `DefaultDict`, making data grouping and calculations easier.
### 4. Error Handling
- **Input Validation:**
- Ensures all user inputs are correctly formatted to prevent unexpected errors:
  - **Numeric Inputs:** Functions like `get_valid_amount` validate that only numeric values are accepted for expenses and budgets.
  - **Date Validation:** The `get_date_input` function ensures users enter dates in the correct `MM-DD-YYYY` format using the `datetime` module.
  - **Menu Choices:** User selections for categories and menu options are validated to prevent invalid inputs.
- **File Handling:**
  - Uses try-except blocks to manage missing or corrupted files:
    Initializes fresh data if expenses.json is missing.
    Resets corrupted files to maintain functionality.
-**Exception Handling**
- Detects and gracefully handles common runtime errors:
  - **Invalid Numeric Inputs:** Prevents crashes when users enter non-numeric values where numbers are required (ex: budgets or expense amounts).
  - **Out-of-Range Inputs:** Ensures user inputs like category selections are within valid ranges.
  - **Empty Data Scenarios:** Handles operations on empty datasets (ex: generating reports or viewing expenses) by displaying user-friendly messages.
- **User Feedback:**
- Provides clear and actionable feedback for errors:
  - **Input Prompts:** Users are guided to correct invalid inputs without terminating the program.
  - **Error Messages:** Messages like "Invalid input. Please enter a numeric value" help users understand and fix their mistakes.
