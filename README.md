## üìñ Project Overview

**Xpense Tracker** is a Python-based financial management system designed to help users effectively track their expenses, set monthly budgets, and monitor spending patterns. It integrates user-friendly features like categorizing expenses, generating detailed reports, and alerting users when their spending exceeds budget limits. With a focus on financial literacy and empowerment, this project supports individuals in making informed decisions about their finances.

 Xpense Tracker helps users stay informed, disciplined, and financially literate. The system aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by promoting responsible consumption and production practices.

## üõ†Ô∏è Application of Python Concepts and Libraries
The Xpense Tracker application is designed with fundamental Python concepts and libraries to deliver a simple, efficient, and user-friendly experience:

### 1. Core Python Concepts
- **Functions:**
  - Modular functions (`add_expense`, `view_expenses`, `generate_report`) divide the program into manageable components, improving readability.
  - Utility functions like `get_valid_amount` and `get_date_input` ensure user inputs are accurate and correctly formatted.

- **Control Flow:**
  - Conditional statements (`if-else`) process user menu selections and handle various program operations.
  - Loops (`while`) maintain interactivity, allowing the program to run continuously until the user exits.

- **Enumerations:**
  - The `Enum` class standardizes expense categories (ex: Food, Transport) for better data consistency and validation.

### 2. Data Structures
- **Lists:** Store expense entries dynamically, enabling efficient addition, modification, and deletion.
- **Dictionaries:** Organize user information and monthly budgets, offering quick access and updates.
- **DefaultDict:** From the `collections` module,  it simplifies data grouping and calculations, especially for monthly expense summaries.
### 3. Key Libraries
- **`datetime`:** Validates and handles dates for accurate logging and tracking.
- **`json`:**  Ensures data persistence by saving user details and expense records in a structured format for future use.
- **`collections`:** Simplifies advanced data handling with `DefaultDict`, making data grouping and calculations easier.
### 4. Error Handling
- **Input Validation:**
  - Prevents invalid inputs by verifying numeric values, correctly formatted dates, and valid menu options.
- **File Handling:**
  - Detects and manages issues like missing or corrupted files, ensuring the program starts with a fresh dataset if needed.
- **User Feedback:**
  - Provides clear and actionable error messages, helping users correct mistakes and continue without interruptions.
