## üõ†Ô∏è Application of Python Concepts and Libraries

### **1. Core Python Concepts**
- **Control Structures**:
  - Conditional statements (`if-elif-else`) for menu navigation and validations.
  - Loops (`for`, `while`) for iterating over data and retrying user inputs.
- **Data Structures**:
  - Lists for storing multiple expense records.
  - Dictionaries to organize user details and budgets.
  - Default dictionaries (`collections.defaultdict`) for grouping expenses by month and category.

### **2. Python Libraries**
- **`datetime`**:
  - Used to handle date inputs and calculations (e.g., grouping expenses by month).
- **`json`**:
  - Facilitates data persistence by saving and loading user data in a JSON file.
- **`enum`**:
  - Provides predefined expense categories to ensure consistency and easy selection.

### **3. Modular Code Design**
- Functions are modular and reusable, ensuring clarity and maintainability:
  - **Utility Functions** for validating inputs (e.g., numeric values, dates).
  - **Expense Management Functions** for adding, viewing, and deleting expenses.
  - **Budget Management Functions** for setting or modifying monthly budgets.
